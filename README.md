# Helmet-Detection-using-YoloV3
the implementation of computer vision techniques for two crucial aspects of road safety: helmet detection and traffic signal control.
By leveraging computer vision algorithms and machine learning models, we aim to develop a system capable of automatically detecting helmet usage among motorcyclists and controlling traffic signals intelligently to enhance safety on roads.
In summary, this presents an overview of our research and development efforts in utilizing computer vision for improving road safety through helmet detection and traffic signal control.
